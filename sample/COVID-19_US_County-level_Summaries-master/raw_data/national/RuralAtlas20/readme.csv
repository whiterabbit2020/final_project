"1.  All indicators included in the atlas are available in this spreadsheet. They are organized in separate tabs for each category of data: People, Jobs, Agriculture, and County Classifications. There are additional indicators available in this spreadsheet that are NOT in the atlas. These are indicated by ""n"" in the ""Map"" column in the Variable Name Lookup tab.",
2. The Variable Name Lookup tab connects the short name used in Row 1 for each indicator with a more detailed description of the indicator.,
3. Counties and county equivalents listed in each tab vary slightly due to different configurations used by the various Federal sources of data. Most variation occurs in Alaska and Virginia. ,
"4. Blank data cells for specific counties indicate values that were not available, not applicable, or suppressed. Consult the data source web pages that may be accessed from the Documentation page of the atlas.",
5. Census of Agriculture county data are available from National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and no longer included in the atlas. ,
